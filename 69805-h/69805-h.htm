      <p class="verse"><em>Heavy, heavy, hangs over thy head.</em></p>
      <p class="verse"><em>Fine, or <a id="corr-2"></a>superfine.</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">heodore</span> Dreiser is old—he is very, very old. I do not know
how many years he has lived, perhaps thirty, perhaps fifty, but he is
very old. Something gray and bleak and hurtful that has been in the world
almost forever is personified in him.
</p>

<p>
When Dreiser is gone we shall write books, many of them. In the
books we write there will be all of the qualities Dreiser lacks. We shall
have a sense of humor, and everyone knows Dreiser has no sense of humor.
More than that we shall have grace, lightness of touch, dreams of beauty
bursting through the husks of life.
</p>

<p>
Oh, we who follow him shall have many things that Dreiser does not
have. That is a part of the wonder and the beauty of Dreiser, the things
that others will have because of Dreiser.
</p>

<p>
When he was editor of <em>The Delineator</em>, Dreiser went one day, with
a woman friend, to visit an orphans’ asylum. The woman told me the
story of that afternoon in the big, gray building with Dreiser, heavy and
lumpy and old, sitting on a platform and watching the children—the terrible
children—all in their little uniforms, trooping in.
</p>

<p>
“The tears ran down his cheeks and he shook his head,” the woman
said. That is a good picture of Dreiser. He is old and he does not know
what to do with life, so he just tells about it as he sees it, simply and
honestly. The tears run down his cheeks and he shakes his head.
</p>

<p>
Heavy, heavy, the feet of Theodore. How easy to pick his books
to pieces, to laugh at him. Thump, thump, thump, here he comes, Dreiser,
heavy and old.
</p>

<p>
The feet of Dreiser are making a path for us, the brutal heavy feet.
They are tramping through the wilderness, making a path. Presently
the path will be a street, with great arches overhead and delicately carved
spires piercing the sky. Along the street will run children, shouting
“Look at me”—forgetting the heavy feet of Dreiser.
</p>

<p>
The men who follow Dreiser will have much to do. Their road is
long. But because of Dreiser, we, in America, will never have to face the
road through the wilderness, the road that Dreiser faced.

A Letter from London

EZRA POUND
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> should be very glad if someone in America could be made to realize
the sinister bearing of the import duty on books. I have tried in vain
to get some of my other correspondents to understand the effect of this iniquity
... but apparently without success. It means insularity, stupidity,
backing the printer against literature, commerce and obstruction
against intelligence. I have spent myself on the topic so many times that
I am not minded to write an elaborate denunciation until I know I am
writing to someone capable of understanding and willing to take up the battle.
Incidentally the life of a critical review depends a good deal on controversy
and on having some issue worth fighting. Henry IV. did away
with the black mediaevalism of an octroi on books, and the position of
Paris is not without its debt to that intelligent act. No country that needs
artificial aid in its competition with external intelligence is fit for any creature
above the status of pig.
</p>

<p>
The tariff should be abolished not only for itself but because dishonest
booksellers shelter themselves behind it and treble the price of foreign books,
and because it keeps up the price of printing.
</p>

<p>
If there is one thing that we are all agreed upon: It is that the canned
goods of Curtis and Company and Harper and Company and all the business
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
firms should be set apart from the art of letters, and the artist helped
against the tradesman.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact a removal of the tariff wouldn’t much hurt even
publishers, as the foreign books we really want in America are the sort
which the greed of American business publishers forbids their publishing
... but that is no matter.
</p>

<p>
It affects every young writer in America, and every reader whether
he wish merely to train his perceptions or whether he train them with a
purpose, of, say, learning what has been done, what need not be repeated,
what is worthy of repetition. There is now the hideous difficulty of getting
a foreign book, and the prohibitive price of both foreign and domestic
publications. I don’t know that I need to go on with it.
</p>

<p>
Again and yet again it is preposterous that our generation of writers
shouldn’t have the facility in getting at contemporary work, which one
would have in Paris or Moscow. It’s bad enough for the American to
struggle against the dead-hand of the past generation composed of clerks
and parasites and against our appalling <em>decentralization</em>, i. e., lack of
metropoles and centers, having full publishing facilities and communication
with the outer world—(which last is being slowly repaired)—also our
scarcity of people who know.
</p>

When all the world goes mad, one must

ALEXANDER S. KAUN
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">ow</span> he hates us, ordinary mortals! No, he seldom hates; he reserves
his hatred for God, for life, for the universe. For us, weak bubbles
driven on the surface by uncontrollable forces, he has only contempt. Yet,
though hating and despising, he is infinitely dear to us: the thick melancholy
vein that bulges across his wildcat forehead makes him almost human;
the taut string of his remote harp vibrates at times with such yearning
and pain that we feel nearly at home with that alien-on-earth, Mikhail
Lermontov. We are glad with a petty gladness whenever we discover in
him this weakness, his humaneness; we chuckle at the comfortable feeling
of being able to observe him on the level plane, freed from the necessity of
throwing our heads far back in order to perceive him on the lonely peak.
He is our brother, we boast; and we inflict on him the severest punishment
for a genius—forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
But his contemporaries could not forgive him. A general sigh of relief
echoed the official announcement of his death “in a fearful storm accompanied
by thunder and lightning on the Beshta mountain in the Caucasus”.
“Bon voyage”, exclaimed Nicholas I, rubbing his hands in glee
over the departure of one of his most undesirable subjects, the uncompromising
mutineer. The church refused to bury the arrogant denier. Society
applauded Major Martinov whose bullet snapped the life of the unapproachable
aristocrat, the mocker of customs and conventions, the maimer of
feminine hearts, the careless, fearless duellist who played with life, his own
or that of others, as with a valueless toy. The people—there was not such
a thing in Russia of 1841.
</p>

<p>
Society organism cannot digest a foreign element. We are too local
in our terrestrial standards to tolerate an individual who is made not of
the same stuff that we are made of. Lermontov was a child of a different
planet who fell upon our earth by some crude mistake, doomed to chafe
twenty-six years among humans. As a child he protested against the fatal
misplacement; he discharged his venom in demolishing flower-beds, in torturing
animals with tears in his eyes, in brandishing his tiny fists against his
grandmother, when he observed her mistreating the serfs. When he grew
up—and he grew up early: at ten he loved a girl; at fifteen he conceived his
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
greatest poems, <em>Mtzyri</em> and <em>Demon</em>—his protest had calmed down. He
no longer wept or raged—he hated God and despised mankind. His contemporaries
tell us that no one could stand his heavy penetrating look. Men
hated and feared him; women hated and loved him, as they always do extraordinary
things. Lermontov took revenge for his accidental association
with mankind; he left behind him a long row of broken hearts and
wounded ambitions. His rebellious spirit sought rest in chaos, in torturing
others and himself, in creating around him an atmosphere of tragedy, in
reckless fighting with the wild Caucasian mountaineers.

<p class="noindent">
Pechorin, the hero of his autobiographical sketches collected in <em>A
Hero of Our Time</em>, is the first Nietzschean in literature. His terse, unpretentious
maxims and paradoxes have been re-echoed by Dostoevsky, Nietzsche,
Przybyszewski, and other writers of the superman-literature. As always
is the case with deliberate or unconscious commentators, they liquefy
the original. One carelessly dropped sentence of Lermontov is elaborated
in tons of Dostoevsky’s gallous psychology, in mountains of Nietzsche’s
brain-splittering philosophy, in cognac-oceans of the vivisectionist-Przybyszewski.
Pechorin does not talk much; he is too aristocratic for extravagance
in words. Pechorin does not compromise; he is not made of that
stuff. He neither repents nor seeks atonement; in his hatred for reality
he does not erect a consoling phantom in the image of a Superman; he
would dismiss with a contemptible shrug Falk’s matrimonial and sexual
tribulations. Pechorin is eternally alone. Those who approach him are
scorched with his unhuman flame. Alone, in the steppe, after a mad
ride which kills his horse, Pechorin hugs the soil and weeps “like a child”.
Like a child pressing to its mother’s bosom, plaintively demanding the Why
and the Wherefore of existence among strangers. Shall we chuckle at
the suddenly-discovered weakness of our enemy? Or shall we modestly
turn away our eyes from the stolen sight of a god in his nudity?
</p>

<p>
I once called Lermontov a sorrowful demon. Not a Lucifer, not a
Mephistopheles, but a Russian demon, as the sculptor Antokolsky conceived
him. Lermontov-Demon-Pechorin, a quaint superman, neither god
nor devil, a pluralistic being, a combination of cruelty and compassion, of
contempt and sympathy, of cynicism and sentimentalism, of the loftiest and
the basest, of the unhuman and of the human-all-too-human. Dostoevsky?

The Poet Speaks

MARGARET C. ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> are people in the world who like poetry if they know the poet.
There are a good many people in Chicago just now who understand
and enjoy Amy Lowell’s poetry because she read it to them at the Little
Theatre.
</p>

<p>
I know a poet who could make nothing of Vachel Lindsay’s things
until Lindsay chanted them to him one day. And I know another who said
to me, when I remarked that I didn’t like Alfred Kreymborg’s verse, “Oh,
but you would if you knew him.” I am puzzled, because I know this man
to be an intelligent being. And somehow I have always been under the
naive impression that poetry was a matter of art.
</p>

<p>
But there are worse things. There is one type of person we always
eject promptly from the office of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. He is the person
who says that Amy Lowell’s poetry has no feeling in it. Now please
listen: I want to quote you something. It is called <em>Vernal Equinox</em>, it
was written by Miss Lowell, and it appeared in the September issue of
<em>Poetry</em>; but I want to see it put down in these pages so that we may
actually know it has been in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">The scent of hyacinths, like a pale mist, lies between me and my book;</p>
      <p class="verse">And the South Wind, washing through the room,</p>
      <p class="verse">Makes the candles quiver;</p>
      <p class="verse">My nerves sting at a spatter of rain on the shutter,</p>
      <p class="verse">And I am uneasy at the bursting of green shoots</p>
      <p class="verse">Outside, in the night.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Why are you not here to overpower me with your tense and urgent love?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
A poet whose new book will soon be talked of said to me, when I
showed this to him, “Yes, it’s very clever, but it has no feeling.” He
left the office gladly in three minutes.
</p>

<p>
Still there are worse things. <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> sent a reporter
to the Little Theatre to hear Miss Lowell read and to record his impression
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
of her work and personality for those who still peruse the newspapers.
You may have seen the reporter’s article....
</p>

<p>
And still worse?... Lots of people have been splitting hairs over
Amy Lowell’s work, but no human being has been heard to remark: “A
beautiful thing is happening in America. Amy Lowell is writing poetry
for us.”

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> are signs of life at the Art Institute. In throwing out Charles
Kinney, it stated the case against itself more emphatically than Kinney
ever could have done. When an “institution” becomes violent over
criticism there is too much work for one reformer.
</p>

<p>
This seems to have been a season for things Art to be stating the case
against themselves. At the last meeting of the Chicago Society of Artists,
when there was a slight murmur of dissatisfaction with the management
of the Institute, one of the older men quickly reminded the painters that
they were but guests of the Institute—and there was silence. Art has
come by hard ways, but never to worse than this:—the guest of the Corn
Exchange Bank!
</p>

<p>
Again at a meeting for the formation of the new Arts Club, before the
matter of the Club could be discussed there had to be a speech assuring
the Art Institute that the artists would never, in any way, <em>ever</em> do anything
on their own, but would always conform to the ideas of the directors
of the Institute. But where they really proved themselves was at
the annual dinner, at the opening of the Chicago Artists’ Exhibition.
Herded into a room they meekly submitted to oyster stew and a speech
by a minister of the Gospel. Artists! That is their case as stated by
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Kinney blames the directors pro tem., and the Dean, for the “factory
system” in the school. Knowing that all the small towns in the West and
Middle West having any kind of an Art School pattern after the Art
Institute, he is excited and fears the factory system will prevail everywhere.
But he might have hope that here and there accidentally a few
artists may get mixed up among the other students and frustrate this plan.
</p>

<p>
It would be interesting to know whether the administration by its
methods has so completely discouraged artists that they no longer seek
the Art Institute as a place of study, or whether the administration is
simply changing its methods to meet the demands of the kind of student
now attending the Institute.
</p>

<p>
This much is certain: no administration could take away every ancient
prerogative of art students; lead them gently into organization; impose
discipline upon them; and appoint God a chaperone over their play—in
fact make a crêche of the school—if there were any of the stuff in them
of which artists are made.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
There always has been a fight on the part of the school to get what it
wanted from the directors; but things can be done. Read the list of “illustrious
names” of visiting instructors, years ago, and then compare the student
roll of the same time. Once the Art Institute was an art school with
art students, who were artists, who in spite of everything led the life of
artists, knew the analogy between painting and the other Arts, swarmed to
concerts and the theatres, and created their own atmosphere. That was
the time when Bernhardt came to the school in her yellow-wheeled carriage
and walked down a double line of quaking, adoring art students.
And when Calvé came to sing.... How many students there now
know these names, know anything beyond fashion drawing?
</p>

<p>
They have indicted themselves. If there were artists the Art Institute
could seek exhibitions. If there were art students we could have an
art school, not a “factory.” And if the directors of the Art Institute and
its patrons really wanted Art, and the directors would throw the Institute
open to all kinds of exhibitions, we might even in time find Art.

he had seen visions of what a town might be.... Nicholas Vachel
Lindsay had been studying Art in Chicago and on his return to Springfield
published, in the fall of 1910, <em>The Village Magazine</em>: a scattering of verse,
prose, sketches, and ornamental designs and propaganda. “Talent for
poetry, deftness in inscribing, and skill in mural painting were probably
gifts of the same person”, he tells us later, in speaking of the ancient Egyptians.
“Let us go back”—the village must be redeemed. The first editorial
in the magazine was <em>On Conversion</em>. The people of Springfield
“should build them altars to the unknown God, the radiant one; He whom
they radiantly worship should be declared unto them in His fullness.” The
next was <em>An Editorial on Beauty for the Village Pastor</em>—it expressed the
belief that the Sunday-school, the Christian Endeavor Society, the Brotherhood,
Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman’s Aid were the forces that
were to bring about beauty. Springfield was to be the new Athens! A
broadside was distributed throughout the village: <em>The Soul of the City
receives the gift of the Holy Spirit</em>:

Verses like the above aside, here was revealed to us a poet; the foundations
were laid, it seemed, for a future. But the youth did dream and see
visions. Much was said about Utopias and the New Jerusalem, and poetry
languished in the youth that he might materialize some ultimate world state.
The most inexcusable optimism of them all—“Rome was not built in a
day.” True, but it <em>was built</em>: not merely talked about or prophesied. And
the youth remembered not that it hath been said in Isaiah: “For, behold,
I create a new heaven and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered
nor come into mind.” Yet the youth remembered the former still
and did say much about the recoming of those civilizations which had been,
at last to stay forever! His day, or the great poet who proceeded him by
but a few years, he seemed to notice not:

      <p class="verse">They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for them,</p>
      <p class="verse">The show passes, all does well enough of course,</p>
      <p class="verse">All does very well till one flash of defiance ...</p>
      <p class="verse">A great city is that which has the greatest men and women;</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
But the youth was at heart the poet, the dreamer, attempting to convince
by arguments, similes, rhymes; not as the great Poet, by mere presence!
Nor could he stand the offer of rough new prizes, preferring the
smooth old prizes. He clung to the organizations of the day, and to
augment their “influence toward the Millennium” he published <em>The Village
Magazine</em>. That, gentle reader, was in 1910.

In the year 1912 there went forth from Springfield this same lad. Into
the West he went—through Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and into New
Mexico. He went preaching a gospel,—his own “Gospel of Beauty.” His
sustenance he earned by reciting his own rhymes to those who were willing,
in exchange, to give him bread. Thus did he make us uncomfortably
imagine him a new John the Baptist, François Villon, or even Saint Francis
of Assisi.... In the year 1914 his account of this adventure was
published. Three rhymes, he claims, contained his “theory of American
civilization.” This is from one of them:

<p class="noindent">
And “At the end of the Road”—by faith and a study of the signs—he
proclaimed the New Jerusalem for America, particularly for his home-village....
Now, there is a peculiar value attached to this journey—the
influence on the poet, not the preacher’s influence on the people. It
was after this trip that we got <em>The Santa Fé Trail</em>, <em>The Fireman’s Ball</em>,
written in a style in which were later written <em>The Chinese Nightingale</em> and
<em>The Congo</em>. And, because of the relation of its style to these, we even
judge <em>I heard Emmanuel Singing</em> a good thing. This, then, is Lindsay’s
importance among us; his contribution of this style of vaudeville chanting.
This is the poet. He does not count when writing <em>Galahad</em>, <em>Knight Who
Perished</em>, <em>King Arthur’s Men Have Come Again</em>, <em>Incense</em>, <em>Springfield Magical</em>,
or declaring “by faith and a study of the signs.”

<p class="noindent">
On November first, 1915, at Springfield, Illinois, Vachel Lindsay
signed a book on <em>The Art of the Moving Picture</em>. The last chapter was
called “The Acceptable Year of the Lord.” From having seen forecastings
in photoplay hieroglyphics the children in times-to-come can rise and
say: “This day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears”:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Scenario writers, producers, photoplay actors, endowers
of exquisite films, sects using special motion pictures
for a predetermined end, all you who are taking the
work as a sacred trust, I bid you God-speed. Consider
what it will do to your souls, if you are true to your
trust.... The record of your ripeness will be found
in your craftsmanship. You will be God’s thoroughbreds.
</p>

<p>
It has come then, this new weapon of men, and the
face of the whole earth changes. In after centuries its beginning
will be indeed remembered.
</p>

<p>
It has come, this new weapon of men, and by faith
and a study of the signs we proclaim that it will go on and
on in immemorial wonder.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
This, then, is the prophecy, and thus has he proclaimed it: “By my
hypothesis, Action Pictures are sculpture-in-motion, Intimate Pictures are
paintings-in-motion, Splendour Pictures are architecture-in-motion....
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
The rest of the work is a series of after thoughts and speculations not
brought forward so dogmatically.”
</p>

<p>
Now, the Arts are complete in themselves; they contain all. The moving
picture has come to be a parasite on them.
</p>

<p>
Sculpture has become a vital thing to this age because of August Rodin.
Meunier has moved us too. Also Monolo and Fagi. Now comes
Lindsay: “I desire for the moving picture not the stillness but the
majesty of sculpture.... Not the mood of Venus de Milo, but let
us turn to that sister of hers—the great Victory of Samothrace”.
</p>

<p>
... I have seen much of Lindsay’s advice followed word for
word since this book of his was published. Tyrone Power in <em>The Dream
of Eugene <a id="corr-14"></a>Aram</em>. Power’s face and figure were more majestic on the
stage than in this picture. There was a “sculpture-group,” as you would
call it, in this picture—a farmer and two squires on a hilltop. It was in
silhouette, a <em>sketch</em> and not sculpture. The nearest I have seen to the
majesty and immobility of sculpture, marble or otherwise, was the head
of William S. Hart in <em>The Aryan</em>. The picture was shadowed so as to
center on his poetic face, the fascination of which none but Forbes Robertson’s
has. Hart’s face on the screen, his eyes looking into the eyes
of you, at his throat a handkerchief of white—a bust by an artist indeed!
But the shadows parted, and the hieroglyphic-crowded background came
into view. Hart’s head moved, became part of a <em>moving picture</em> and sculpture
was no more. The moment was worth it—but it <em>moved</em>....
“Moving pictures are pictures and not sculpture”, says Lorado Taft in a
public statement, objecting to Lindsay’s phrase. “To a sculptor the one
thing cherished as most essential to his art is its static quality, its look of
absolute quiescence. It is the hint of eternity which marks and makes all
monumental art”.... Has Lindsay no feeling for sculpture?
</p>

<p>
Frank Lloyd Wright has models in plaster of some of his buildings—“modern”
skyscrapers, hotels, and homes, growing, rising upward, white
and beautiful. It was these works of architecture which called forth the
phrase “flowers in stone”. He alone, it seems, has made art of architecture
in our day. He objects to Lindsay saying his art can be that of moving
pictures; its very literalness, its actualness being the very negation of
the soul and constitution of art. In <em>The Dumb Girl of Portici</em> the Smalleys,
as inspired as any of the producers, used the entire Field Museum in
Jackson Park, Chicago, as a background for a pageant of Italian royalty,
of the middle ages. Insisting on architecture can spoil pictures. It did
this one.
</p>

<p>
Painting-in-motion—rhythm. Rhythm seems alien to the application
of the theory of jerky fade-away close-ups. “Intimate Dutch interior”
scenes fading into the close-up and then back into the entire scene again.
Intimate, friendly, and moving, but lacking in rhythm and the flow of naturalness.
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
Some think that “moving lines”, made an art in themselves,
will be an achievement of the moving film. Have you ever been struck
dumb by the lines made by a dancer across the stage, the moving of life
across life? I have seen it in the moving-picture only in the flight of gulls
(unconscious actors) or in pictures of rivers and trees and the sea; in
short—nature. But nature is nature. The painter’s art! Botticelli’s
<em>Spring</em>, or <em>The Birth of Venus</em>—pictures containing the essence of rhythmic
natural movement. Never yet have the movies given us this. If Lindsay
must prophesy and “take the masses back to art” there <em>are</em> artists living today—who
are for today. Lindsay seems to know nothing of them. His
knowledge of painting seems to have stopped with his art school days. The
later work of Jerome Blum, for example, has this movement, this rhythm,
not only in composition and line but in the <em>color</em> as well. Reds and greens
and blues that vibrate, paintings that live.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this might be entitled: “An open letter to Vachel Lindsay”,
for it is “not so dogmatically set forth” and is mere man-to-man
talk.
</p>

<p>
I have seen most of your suggestions swallowed whole by moving-picture
makers.... Your hieroglyphics idea—well, James Oppenheim
was an accomplice in that. “On Coming Forth by Day” or your suggestion
to use the Book of the Dead—a Chicago woman, the patient, too-patient,
beautifully reverent Lou Wall Moore has been working for years on an
adaptation of one of the books which, when it does appear on the stage,
will have more rhythm and terrible swiftness than ever your moving picture
could, the splendor of color, space, height, distance, and most magical
of all, the voice:

As for your “too ruthless a theory” of having silence in the theatre,
or rather just the hum of conversation, let me tell you of the “midnight-movies”
in our town: Can you imagine a crowd of people standing in
line outside a theatre at one or a quarter after in the morning? And inside
an audience—or optience?!—which for interest and variety can equal
any of the moving-pictures shown or yet to be shown. I wish you could
hear the ludicrous, cutting, knowing remarks made by these people about
your pictures, when, after twelve-thirty the piano stops, and the oppressive
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
silence outweighs the interest of the picture. (The piano formerly stopped
at eleven, but the management decided that the only way to maintain order
was to keep the piano going.) Well, the silence never lasts: snoring,
wheezing, roaring, shouting and laughing and calls for “Silence”, “Wake
up, the rest of us wanna sleep”, “You’re off key”, or “What time shall I
call, sir?” These people are here: business men; newsboys, hobos, drunks,
who sleep here all night; salesmen; night clerks; telegraphers; bell-boys;
hotel and restaurant maids; scrub-women; actors; <a id="corr-16"></a>vaudevillians; cabaret
singers; pressmen; newspapermen; chauffeurs, teamsters; traveling men;
gentlemen of leisure; painted youths and scented women. They “get” the
psychology of the pictures. Helen’s hazards call forth telegraph tappings
to each other; close-ups showing jealousy, rage, or overdone emotion get
“woof-woofs” and howls and hoots; the murder prevented “just in time”
gets its sarcasms; and “immoral situations” their due appreciation. But—this,
which seemed on the way to become our most individual phase of
night-life, is passing. The jolly manager, who passed up and down the
aisle like a hen among her brood, keeping us awake until one o’clock, has
been replaced by a uniformed policeman; the council has legislated women
out after two o’clock; and a “ride in the wagon” or ejection faces the one
who would “get gay”. Now, as a place of interest, it is passing in this
day of short-lived gayety and censored originality. The Law, Lindsay, will
not allow your plan to work. In the neighborhoods?—the audiences themselves
do not know why they are there. Why disturb them?
</p>

<p>
Your educational film also I have seen applied. <em>Saved From the
Flames</em> worked out in co-operation with the New York Fire department.
It teaches a lesson. So does <em>The Human Cauldron</em>—your own phrase, I
believe, taken from the first line of page forty-two, your book. This picture
was done with the aid of the New York Police department. Both
were stupid, inane in story and treatment, and on the whole a bore. Even
Walthall couldn’t save <em>The Raven</em> from cardboard clouds and angels and
“visions”.
</p>

<p>
Your scenario, the “second cousin to the dream that will one day come
forth”, seems quite symbolic of your prophecies. Pallas Athena, Jeanne
D’Arc, and Our Lady Springfield; a treeless hill top in Washington Park:
this then is the rank of the Goddesses. Springfield is to have secular
priests and her patriots are irresolute! “Without prophecy there can be
no fulfillment. Without Isaiah there can be no Christ”.—A truly Christian
interpretation of the Hebrew’s great Isaiah, to whom Christ was but a
disciple! But so you will have it.... We need Isaiahs and John
the Baptists, but they were prophets and fore-runners of a Christ, a personality—not
a Utopia, World State or International Brotherhood. If
you appear before us as an Isaiah we demand to hear of your Christ.
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
You recognize the demand of Confucius for rectification of names. Do
you realize Nietzsche’s transvaluations for our day? Faith as opposed to
affirmation! Zarathustra has spoken! There is now the mountain peak—and
you are still rhyming about a hill top.

<p>
It is to be the same production with which Emanuel Reicher
stirred New York this winter. Mr. Reicher is no longer with the
company, having finally given up the struggle of trying to make a
financial success of art and truth. His stage director, Augustin
Duncan, who is a man of vision and ability, has formed the actors
into a co-operative company, and they have been struggling through
various cities where their efforts have been intensely though not
largely appreciated. This is to be expected; but surely in Chicago
they ought to find an audience.
</p>

<p>
P. S.—Since I wrote the above <em>The Weavers</em> has opened, and
I have heard how the first-night audience laughed where it should
have applauded and guffawed when it should have recognized something
fine.

birth control as a thing in which everybody believes, and which
almost everybody practices whether they believe in it or not. It
seems quite superfluous to keep on talking about it. But then you
remember that Emma Goldman has been arrested for talking about
it, and that when her trial comes up—some time this month or in
May—it is quite within the possibilities that she may spend a year
in prison for her crime. That is something none of us could face
without a kind of insanity. So please don’t be content with merely

will be given to the Royal Literary Fund. Mr. Browne adds that
the nickels and dimes of those who wish to make their offering,
but cannot afford the larger sum, will be welcomed in the spirit of
their giving; also that he believes there are many admirers of

opportunity to pay in some measure their debt to the poet, particularly
remembering that this city stimulated and interested him more

Flamingo Dreams

<p class="aut">
LUPO DE BRAILA
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> burst of passion in a pagan god’s eye was the sunrise as I saw
it from the top of Mount Rose one morning last summer. Trembling
and with squinting eyes I looked at the grand spectacle, fearing to
go blind if I opened my eyes.
</p>

<p>
The sun stretched its arms and with flaming fingers lifted the bluish-grey
blanket from the Nevada hills and the Truckee Valley. Feeling that
the beauty of this moment could not be surpassed, I turned my face
toward California and ran down the western side of Mount Rose.
</p>

<p>
One day last week when the massive shoulders of Jerome Blum
stepped in between me and a canvas that had transformed his studio
into a strange land for me, I wanted to hold his hands for fear the next
canvas would take the joy produced by the one in front of me. He
came back from an eight-months’ trip through Japan and China recently,
and he brought with him over twenty paintings with pulsating nature and
unrestrained joy in every one of them. The rhythmic lines dance through
the curling roofs and weird trees—and all of them are bathed in sunshine.
At the same time they are a close study of this strange land, its people
and their habits, by a forceful and unusual artist—a man who says “yes”
to nature in no uncertain terms. His bold colors are handled in a most
sensitive manner, and when I wanted to place him among the Chicago
artists I found that he belongs to an entirely different class and could
not even be compared to some of the vacillating and doubtful men who
paint in this town.
</p>

<p>
He has a portrait of a Chinese girl in a green gown, and some scenes
along a canal and in a Chinese garden, that have tempted my usually
honest mind to some queer contemplations. I have found myself wandering
to the windows and other unusual entrances to his studio, figuring out
how one might find access to that place without a key and at a certain
dark hour. I have only one hope left now of owning one in a figurative
way, and it is that the trustees of the Art Institute may see the light
and....
</p>

<p>
I hope Jerome Blum will not be compelled, like some of the best
men this country has produced, to go to other shores to gain the recognition
due a man of his ability. A few weeks ago I saw one of the older
trustees spend considerable time before a canvas by a Boston painter that
lacked all that goes to make a work of art,—a canvas on which the
artist, with the aid of a pointed stick, had tried to prod his dead and
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
colorless paint into some kind of motion. In spite of this I still believe
that they will rise to the high intellectual and artistic understanding that
they are supposed to possess, but which they have failed to display up
to the present, as far as modern art is concerned.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible for me to describe any of Blum’s canvases except
to say that they tear you away from the dirty grey and ill-smelling Chicago,
to a country you have seen in your dreams as a child. We will have
a chance to see this artist’s work, beginning April fifteenth, at O’Brien’s,
on Michigan Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
Lucille Swan Blum will exhibit at the same time and place some very
graceful Japanese dancers, Chinese children, Corean, Chinese, and Japanese
mothers with their babies and other far-eastern types. Best of all is a
Chinese philosopher, reduced almost to design to emphasize the idea of
the age and wisdom of this people—folded hands, an emotionless face,
all seeing eyes....

On the first page of his new book, “<em>Moby Lane and Thereabouts</em>”, Neil
Lyons says: “Spring has many ushers, and is heralded by divers signs.
Some people look for these signs among the hedgerows; others seek them
in the sky, or listen for them in the night, whilst other people neither look
or listen, but go smelling about, or stand upon hill-tops, tasting.” My sign
shall be, I think, the grimy trees of the Square. And sometimes as I sit
here looking out on the icy barrenness I wonder if, when Spring’s breath
does touch the earth, whether flowers will come up—flowers that I long to
see: crocuses, anemones, daffodils. It’s all very well to see them in shop
windows, but God! to see them come up out of the earth and unfold! But
I fear our Square is too sophisticated. I know a man will come—a common
tobacco-chewing man with a stunted soul who belongs to a Union
and gets paid so much coin by the hour—and he will arrange squares, and
oblongs, and diamond shaped plots of earth. Then will he proceed laboriously
and without joy to stick tulips or some other straight official flower
into these geometrical, soulless patterns. And throughout the year in the
Square, nature will be kept in bounds and orders.

<h3 class="section" id="HENRYVIII">
“<em>Henry VIII</em>”
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It seems scarcely possible that Sir Herbert Tree would have the calm
artistic audacity to come to this country and present his production of
“Henry VIII” in the moth-eaten scenery and costumes that were used
in the London production in the year 1910. Yet he did, and oh! the wearisome
drab antiquity of it all! But the “People” liked it and gave the beknighted
actor-manager “one of the greatest premieres that New York
has witnessed these many years”.
</p>

<p>
Mention is made in the programme of “the inspiring aerchiological advice”
of Percy Macquoid, R. I. The advice may have been quite inspiring.
I do not doubt it. But the results of that advice! That medley of costumes!
Those photo scenes of Windsor Castle and Blackfriars Hall and
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
Westminster Abbey! They were bad when first conceived and painted,
and five years in a London storeroom has not improved them to any degree
compatible with their presentation to an audience that has looked upon
the work of <a id="corr-24"></a>Bakst, Urban, Jones, Sime, and Rothenstein.
</p>

<p>
And what can be said of the lighting? There was one comic spotlight
that followed Sir Herbert (or ought I to say Wolsey? I hardly
know; they were never quite distinct) around the stage like a little motherless
puppy. Sometimes it went before, sometimes it frisked after, on the
tail of his magnificent scarlet gown. It had a grand time! But it never
seemed to be doing the thing it ought to be doing.
</p>

<p>
But let me not bore you as these things bored me. Pass we now to
the acting. In London the honors of the play were carried off by Arthur
Bouchier as Henry, and his wife, Violet Vanburgh, as Katherine. A repetition
was performed here. Lyn Harding as Henry, and Edith Wynne
Matheson as Katherine, carried every one before them. And Tree? Well,
he had his moments. There was his superb entrance with the look he
flashed at Buckingham: fine too was the acting in the scene of his downfall.
Between these two highlights such ordinary acting has seldom been
seen in a man of Tree’s reputation. In a cold classic way Miss Matheson
was splendid. I liked her much, and but for her some of the scenes in
the play would have been colourless. There was the usual mob of supers
who got caught in doorways and tripped over furniture, but on the whole
they behaved as well as an ordinary stage manager can make such people
behave.

<em>Yvette Guilbert</em>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Five years ago I saw Yvette Guilbert in London. I loved her all.
Her red hair; the skinny arms of her, clothed in long black gloves; and
her Gallic body with the low-necked white crinoline that gowned it. And
how she sang!! And her acting! For five years I have carried the memory
of her around with me, matching other people up with her but never
finding her equal. On Sunday, March nineteenth, I saw her again. The
black gloves and the white crinoline were gone, and she had grown a little
stouter. The red hair was there, and the smile. Her voice had changed a
bit and her personality had mellowed. She sang songs that were grave
and moving, like Fiona Macleod’s <em>Prayer of Women</em>, and others that were
gay and jocular, like <em>The Curé Servant</em>. But whatever she sang—and I
didn’t know a word of what she sang—carried me away completely. Not a
mood did I miss—not a suggestion of a mood. Perfect is her art. She
has my adoration.

further comment. Joseph Urban did the stage settings. Richard Ordynski
directed the production. Willy Pogany designed the costumes. Gordon

beings. After seeing the work expended on <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em>

<em>Soulless New York</em>

Witter Bynner, grown somber and blase,—the effect of living in
soulless New York, he says—has become a sort of Greek Chorus to me.
In various strophes with divers variations, in sundry public and private
places, he chants the dismal fact that New York is soulless and that there
is a danger of it robbing me of my joy in life. Not while its streets remain
as they are will I lose the joy I possess! I cannot remember any
city that I have been in where my sense of the comic has been tickled so
often by happenings in the streets. So many comedies are enacted by the
curbstone, so many quaintly funny things happen every hour on the streets,
that it would be impossible for me to forget how jolly life really is. Of
course I see tragedies too, but they seem to be there only for the purpose
of balance!
</p>

<p>
For some time to come I’ll Dalcroze down the avenues and numerical
by-ways of this “soulless” city. And my smile will always be handy; and
my whistle wet, ready to pipe <em>Gathering Peascods</em> or <em>The Parson’s Farewell</em>
or anything merry and bright to dance to.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">lice</span> Gerstenberg, who dramatized <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, wrote <em>Overtones</em>,
evidently as an experiment, and had it produced in New York. Now
it is crowding vaudeville houses. As an experiment only is it important.
Cyril Harcourt intends collaborating with Miss Gerstenberg to produce a
three-act play on the same lines: characters being followed by their “real
selves”, veiled, with voices confused. A Shaw play might be done this
way—it is a method effective for moralizing and bringing home a point.
But why would Darling Dora need an overtone or an undertone; or Blanco
Posnet or Fanny’s Father? If there is any reason for the dramatic
presentation of characters at all it is the drama of themselves—their actions
and their thoughts as opposed to those of others.... Imagine
Rebecca West being followed through three acts by a “real self”; or Ulric
Brendel—“... I am homesick for the mighty nothingness”.

</h3>

<p class="subt">
(<em>Vague Questionings</em>)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It evidently means—this phrase—“that which is <em>accepted</em> as new”....
There are signs of our dangerously settling down to flat brilliant
backgrounds, spots of vivid color, and much <em>mention</em> of “important as
decoration”. It seems an unhealthy acquiescence.... “Is desire a
thing of nothing, that a five-years’ quest can make a parody of it? Your
whole life is not too long, and then only at the very end will some small
atom of what you have desired come to you.”—Gordon Craig in his <em>Art
of the Theatre</em>. It looks as if we are due for a period of the old, old,
three-walled room with the new, new, “new” color.... I don’t believe
we will find the future in Michael Carr’s butterfly proscenium and
moving-picture screen shadows; but, surely, it is not <em>The Man Who Married
a Dumb Wife</em>, or <em>Androcles and the Lion</em>, although Barker’s <em>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</em> costumes are the most far-reaching originalities yet
seen. Nor will it be like <em>A Pair of Silk Stockings</em>, <em>The Sabine Women</em>,
<em>Overtones</em>, <em>The Charity that Began at Home</em>, <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, nor
Urban and his present enormous New York output of “designs” and “follies”.
Our only light seems to come from Gordon Craig’s work in Florence.
“In his work is the incalculable element; the element that comes of
itself and cannot be coaxed into coming”. Or from Sam Hume’s enthusiasm
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
over the “Dome”; Reinhardt, of course, has almost acquired his
permanent “angle of repose”—the newness of the American stage being, in
fact, the Reinhardt of yesterday. If I had my way, I’d destroy all books
about the theatre excepting those of Gordon Craig, for inspiration, or
those of Arthur Symons for appreciation.... Then, perhaps, we
should begin to understand the Theatre.

Sarah Bernhardt has been playing a patriotic play, <em>Les Cathedrales</em>,

play; nothing more need be said. Bernhardt plays one of the seven cathedrals,
<em>Strasburg</em>. In the interview, quoted above, given to the London

to me that artists in the Allied Countries, and also authors, painters, composers,
and all those concerned in the theatre have to bind themselves into
a league for removing all traces of German nature and influence from our
plays and theatres.... Now the German showman Reinhardt flooded
Paris and London with the Berliner deluge of the spectacular. He claims
artistic superiority on the grounds of having introduced several novel trivialities.
But to trace the real curve of truth I must say that he did nothing
of the kind. He merely revived, in <em>Sumurun</em> and <em>Oedipus Rex</em>, certain
outworn conventions which existed before his time! But he has not the
honesty to acknowledge it.” Later she does say something worth thinking
over: “What he has done is to use Eastern methods for Western ideas
when he should have used Eastern ideas for Western methods.” Plagiarism
is an irrelevant charge to bring against an artist, but acknowledging an
artistic right to adaptation means expansion and, despite nationalism, a
universal one-ness.

</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">V</span><span class="postfirstchar">ery,</span> very clever. The ultimate emptiness of cleverness. These parodies
are “not a piece of buffoonery so much as a critical exposition”,—the
poet expects them to approach this “elevated and illuminating” standard;
but they never reach satire, which is really the thing that is covered by the
above quotation from Isaac Disraeli.
</p>

<p>
Untermeyer’s verse, including <em>Challenge</em> and that so quantitatively
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
published in the magazines,—still speaking comparatively,—has the same
relation to poetry as Urban’s scenery for <em>The Follies</em> has to his Boston
Opera settings; or of all of Urban’s work to that of the numerous German
poster school of five or eight years ago. Untermeyer is lenient in parodying
poets of his own ilk—but it is easy to determine which of those he
does not respect by his obvious, spiteful absurdities.
</p>

<p>
For years now newspaper paragraphers, “poets”, and editors have been
saying such things as “It is time we are getting ourselves talked about”
when mentioning Ezra Pound. Untermeyer stoops to it; he is still the
“once born” when being “critical” about Amy Lowell: “A blue herring
sings”. What he is really parodying here is his colleague Walt Mason’s
prose-printed jingles which are syndicated throughout newspaperdom; he
is not giving a “critical exposition” of polyphonic prose. It will need a
keener critic or poet than he to do it—or to produce a parody or satire
whose art equals that of the thing satired—Masters’s things for example.
By ambling through thirty-seven lines Untermeyer imagines that he is
being master of the situation as regards Masters. And the last line of
the parody on James Oppenheim might very well have been written by
Untermeyer himself as one of his own: “Clad in the dazzling splendor of
my awakened self”.... No matter what may have been your attitude
toward the poets parodied these things leave your feelings unchanged—except
that he makes more definite your attitude towards him.

These books are not war-literature—a compliment not often deserved
in these days of ink-war demoralization. The lay, unbiased reader, who is
inclined to learn facts rather than to find interpretations substantiating his
prejudices, will enjoy the three books as a rare treat. They are very much
unlike. Mr. Schevill is a historian par excellence, and lends a broad perspective
to the related facts. He also lends a rich romantic flavor to his
narrative, an emotional undercurrent—so unfrequent a feature with academic
writers. His point of view may not be universally acceptable; even
in history there are events and phenomena which belong to the autonomous
region of taste and opinion. The scene of the triumphant Prussians solemnizing
their victory in Versailles, for example, may arouse differing
emotions and reflections. Mr. Schevill bows in reverence before the three
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
heroic figures of Emperor William (“not unlike the legendary Barbarossa”),
Bismarck, and Moltke. We may likewise not share his enthusiasm
for the German idea of State, as superior to Anglo-Saxon individualism.
But we cannot help admiring the general brilliancy of the treatment
of the gigantic subject, and if we are capable of getting instructed,
our reading of the book will amply reward us.
</p>

<p>
M. Sarolea is a Belgian, hence pro-Ally and anti-German, hence unreservedly
Russophil, hence not wholly impartial. It is a poor service to
Russia, the unqualified praise of all her institutions and traits on the part
of her friends. Exaggerated eulogy is apt to arouse suspicion. If M. Sarolea
had interchanged his Mercurian sprightliness for Professor Veblen’s
solidity, both would have gained considerably. Mr. Veblen takes us as
far back as the pre-historic Baltic tribes in order to prove his point of the
peculiar aptitude of the Prussians for borrowing. He certainly succeeds
in his attempt, but at the expense of the reader’s patience and eye-sight
which is subjected to the perusal of endless pages of miniature type. His
scientific style is surcharged with profound sarcasm, and if you are fond
of delicate subtleties the book will afford you “great sport.” Schevill, historian;
Sarolea, publicist; Veblen, economist—the common feature of the
three, particularly of the first and of the last, is respect for the reader
who is treated with facts and not with phantoms for the sake of argument.

“SPIRITUAL ADVENTURES”
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>Anonymous</em>:
</p>

<p>
At your suggestion I have begun to read Arthur Symons’s “Spiritual Adventures.”
</p>

<p>
“Christian Trevelga” strikes me, as you predicted, most strongly so far. Symons
is one of the subtlest of minds; everything he writes is worth reading. This is of
his best certainly. What is one to make of him? I don’t know. I don’t know
whether his kind of subtlety is of any earthly value, or whether it is as valuable
as Shelley’s. I can never give up faith in the human race quite as completely as
he does, nor adopt his attitude of autocratic detachment; yet I never seem to have
any real faith, either.—<em>Vae victis!</em>
</p>

<p>
He is removed from all sense of human values, and lost, always, in abstract
patterns. This particular story is an extraordinary expression of him—of the prizes
and peril of such a state. Oh, hell! what an insult is put upon us when we are
invited to live, and to make such a choice.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one makes it: then he is not happy until he has lost himself in an art
that is “something more than an audible dramatization of human life.” Perhaps he
is right. But—
</p>

<p>
But—but—
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I <em>know</em> that for the greatest artist there would be no chasm between
what the heart desires and what the mind constructs. Tell me how to do that in
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
poetry and I’ll give you a dollar. Perhaps it can be done in music—I don’t know.
But in poetry the human heart and the mathematical soul are always fighting—and
so far as I know they have not yet come to an agreement—not in English poetry,
at least. The artist and the human being never get to be bedfellows. It’s either
sickening humanitarianism or stark designing—the second is the less painful.
</p>

<p>
Well!—I loathe the world, including Symons and all the arts.

out to prove Ficke’s belief that the sonnet is “Gawd’s own city.” However, he seems
to have abandoned that church. I still don’t know whether you send me the magazine
in order to encourage me in believing that my camp stool by Helicon is to be left
free from tacks, or whether the paper is sent to convert me from error.

<em>The Egoist</em> is about to publish Joyce’s “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man”

draw attention to them, and to the sporting endeavor of <em>The Egoist</em> to do in this dark
isle what the <em>Mercure</em> has so long done in France, i. e., publish books as well as a

I hope the last half of that article was not meant to be satire or wit or anything

</p>

<p>
Why should not vibrant life assert itself after its kind, even in the presence of
death? What desecration was there in this man and woman coming together in
such presence, drawn by the invincible magnetism of sex? What of falsity to life
was there in the lawyer’s giving and answering the call of life as to this woman,
even though he had a wife whom he loved?
</p>

<p>
Why conjure up an atmosphere of guilt that neither man nor woman felt?
Why suggest such hair-bristling horror as to the accidental overturning of a dead
man’s body, any more than over the accidental upsetting of a vase, or a statue, in
the course of a dance? Why such strained effort to make that specialized expression
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
of vibrant life which is the very pivotal centre of all life appear as the degradation of
degradation, degrading everything else, even death?
</p>

Will you answer that there is an eternal and universal sense of the fitness of
things with which every soul may be lightened that cometh into the world? Shall
I not reply to you that this is a lie against life—that life is sacrificed every day to
this lie? Shall I not say to you that vibrant life must not allow itself to be sacrificed
to such lies—that vibrant life must create anew continually a sense of the
fitness of things for itself and for its every new expression—that it must do this
with authority, shaking itself bravely free from the clutch of the dead hand, whether
as to traditions, standards, customs, morals, ideals or love even? Shall I not say
to you that Life must assert its right to Live? Shall we not organize life on such

REVIEWING “THE LITTLE REVIEW”
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>Virginia York in “The Richmond Evening Journal”</em>:
</p>

<p>
As we said a couple of months ago, <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, published in windy
Chicago, is claimed by its editors and readers to be the very, very last word in
prose and poetry. Also, it is the organ, the mouth organ, perhaps, of that unsustained
tune known as “vers libre.” In a criticism of some of the Review’s lurid, foolish
contents we poked a good deal of fun at the publication in general and one piece
of loose, or free, verse in particular. This gem, entitled, “Cafe Sketches,” by Arthur
Davison Ficke, said, in part:
</p>

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
              <p class="verse4">Presently persons will come out</p>
      <p class="verse">And shake legs.</p>
      <p class="verse">I do not want legs shaken.</p>
      <p class="verse">I want immortal souls shaken unreasonably.</p>
      <p class="verse">I want to see dawn spilled across the blackness</p>
      <p class="verse">Like a scrambled egg on a skillet;</p>
      <p class="verse">I want miracles, wonders.</p>
      <p class="verse">Tidings out of deeps I do not know, ...</p>
      <p class="verse">But I have a horrible suspicion</p>
      <p class="verse">That neither you</p>
      <p class="verse">Nor your esteemed consort</p>
      <p class="verse">Nor I myself</p>
      <p class="verse">Can ever provide these simple things</p>
      <p class="verse">For which I am so patiently waiting</p>
      <p class="verse">Base people.</p>
      <p class="verse">How I dislike you!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
As we said a couple of months ago, “Maybe you think this is funny, but certainly
it is not intended to be. Seriousness, thick, black, dense seriousness is the keynote of
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.” However, the current issue of said magazine carries our
editorial remarks in full, and with our hand on our heart we make a deep courtesy
for the honor conferred upon us. Though we distinctly deplore the fact that absolutely
no comment is made upon our criticism of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> and Mr. Ficke’s
remarkable “pome.” It is as if we were taken by the editorial legs and shaken.
And we do not want legs shaken. We are a lady. We would far rather have our
immortal editorial soul shaken unreasonably and spilled across the literary blackness
and blankness “like a scrambled egg on the skillet.” Yet, we have a horrible idea
“that neither you,” nor our esteemed contemporary, “nor I myself,” know what
it is all about; but we do wish that Margaret Anderson and the other editors of “Le
Revue Petite” had made a few caustic remarks on our feeble attempts to be funny.
“Base people! How I dislike you!”
</p>

<p>
But to show that we can be generous and heap coals of fire upon the heads
of our enemies, we propose to reproduce two short, sweet poems from this month’s
(beg pardon, the January-February issue, lately out, “on account of having no funds
during January,” as the Review editors admit) issue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. The
first selection on our program, ladies and gentlemen, is by Harriet Dean and is called
“The Pillar,” though much more effectively it might have been headed “The Pillow”
or “The Hitching-Post.” Here goes:
</p>

  <div class="poem-container">
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">When your house grows too close for you,</p>
      <p class="verse">When the ceilings lower themselves, crushing you,</p>
      <p class="verse">There on the porch I shall wait,</p>
      <p class="verse">Outside your house.</p>
      <p class="verse">You shall lean against my straightness,</p>
      <p class="verse">And let night surge over you.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
Now if it were only a nice slim lamp-post of a man giving such an invitation
we should pray that the ceilings would descend, and should hasten to the porch—strangely
enough on the outside of the house—and we should love to lean, and lean,
and lean, surge what may.
</p>

<p>
The second, an “Asperity,” by Mitchell Dawson, is labeled “Teresa,” and madly
singeth as follows:
</p>

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">“Do you remember Antonio—</p>
      <p class="verse">Swift-winged, green in the sun?</p>
      <p class="verse">Into the snap-dragon throat of desire</p>
      <p class="verse">Flew Antonio.</p>
      <p class="verse">Snap!...</p>
      <p class="verse">The skeleton of Antonio has made</p>
      <p class="verse">A good husband, a good provider.”</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
La, la, la! At first we thought “Antonio” was a green dragon fly, but, finally,
by exercising a bit of common sense, we know that Tony is a locust and left his
“skeleton,” or “shell,” behind; and that Mrs. Tony must have subsisted on the
“leavings.”
</p>

<p>
Oh, this nut sundae, chocolate fudge, marshmallow whip vers libre poetry! Isn’t
it just too lovely? Snap! “Into the snap-dragon throat of desire, Flew Antonio.”
Honestly now, Tony, don’t you wish the lady had kept her mouth shut?
</p>

<p>
We should like to comment upon these remarks, but surely they are too good
to spoil.

FROM “THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL JOURNAL”
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
A case in point showing how little has been achieved by our medical men who
have gone among the people, torch in hand, to lead them to the Promised Land of
happiness and content and physical and mental health has been well illustrated in a
poem, recently published in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> (Chicago), wherein the authoress,
Mary Aldis, unwittingly indicts the whole medical profession for still allowing the
sale of a patent medicine to reduce obesity. The strange title of the poem in homely
and unadorned “free verse” is “Ellie: The Tragic Tale of An Obese Girl.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Aldis—thus runs the poem—had a manicurist who was “a great big lummox
of a girl—a continent,” with “silly bulging cheeks and puffy forehead,” and who
one day said to the poetess, weeping and distraught: “I’m so fat, so awful, awful fat!
The boys won’t look at me.” She asked Mrs. Aldis for help and Mrs. Aldis suggested,
“A doctor’s vague advice to bant and exercise,” and “Ellie and her woes passed from
my mind. Until, as summer dawned again, I heard that she was dead.” Mrs. Aldis
went to the funeral and saw Ellie lying in her coffin and was told by Ellie’s mother,
“She must a made it [the dress] by herself. It’s queer it fitted perfectly, An’ her
all thin like that.” Later in the evening Mrs. Aldis received the following confidences
from Ellie’s mother: “’Twas the stuff she took that did it, I never knew
till after she was dead. The bottles in the woodshed, hundreds of ’em, All labelled
‘Caldwell’s Great Obesity Cure Warranted Safe and Rapid.’”
</p>

<p>
To sermonize here, we have Mrs. Aldis, who we know to be a highly intelligent
woman and one not only interested in the uplift of the drama but also in the uplift
of the common (?) people, merely saying to a girl, who is wretchedly unhappy about
her elephantine size: All that I can give you is a doctor’s vague advice to bant
and exercise. She might have given her Vance Thompson’s epoch-making book “Eat
and Grow Thin,” or read chapters from it to the unhappy girl, thereby convincing
her that starvation is unnecessary and also a patent medicine. But with a coldness
that is most reprehensive, she gave “a doctor’s vague advice to bant and exercise,”
and evidently Ellie would none of this. She might also have consulted the hundred
and one doctors in Chicago or elsewhere who specialize in the reduction of fat, and
who could have given her for “the continent” a diet chart or perhaps a pill to effect
the desired change. But she did not think this necessary; she did not feel it her
duty. But if we have only adverse criticism for Mrs. Aldis’ uncharitable act, what
direful words of commination should we not visit on the doctor who gave the
“vague advice.” In an age when the cult of slimness is uppermost in everybody’s
mind, is it possible that the doctor consulted by Mrs. Aldis was so untrue to his
mission as a public benefactor that he gave only “vague advice,” or is Mrs. Aldis
maligning the whole medical profession and trying to show that by his “vague advice”
the doctor was really responsible for Ellie’s death by driving her into taking “the
bottles in the woodshed, hundreds of ’em. All labelled ‘Caldwell’s Great Obesity
Cure Warranted Safe and Rapid.’”?
</p>

<p>
The lesson contained in the poetic lines of Mrs. Aldis’ little tragedy is a bitter
one for all those medical men who have made strenuous efforts to let the public
share their deep and vast knowledge without so much as asking for the slightest
compensation. It shows beyond a doubt that not only are the Ellies of this world
unwilling to imbibe science in a popular form, but also the Aldises of a much
higher intelligence. It shows that the lure of patent medicine is a very strong one
and that a doctor’s “vague advice” cannot offset it. Strange, indeed, that a doctor’s
“vague advice” should be so inconsequential opposite so patently fraudulent a preparation
as “Caldwell’s Great Obesity Cure,” but stranger still is what we are about
to record—namely, the failure of our medical propagandists to combat in an intelligent
way that most simple of all our metabolic disturbances—obesity!

<p>
There will be three judges, the appointing of whom has been
left to the editor of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. (Their names will be
given in the next issue, as we are hurrying this announcement to
press without having had time to consult anyone.)
</p>

<p>
There will be two prizes of $25 each. They are offered not
as a first and second prize, but for “the two best short poems in
free verse form.”
</p>

<p>
As there will probably be a large number of poems to read,
we suggest that contributors adhere closely to the conditions of
the contest.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
